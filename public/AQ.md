## Overview

The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess autistic traits in individuals who are 16 or older and have an IQ within the normal range (IQ >=80).

### Basic Information

- **Statements**: 50
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Type**: Screening tool
- **Authors**: Simon Baron-Cohen
- **Publishing Year**: 2001
- **Seminal Paper**: "The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ): Evidence from Asperger Syndrome/High-Functioning Autism, Males and Females, Scientists and Mathematicians" by Baron-Cohen et al., 2001

## Intended Audience

The test is primarily designed for:

- Adults (age 16+) of average or higher intelligence.[^1]

## Versions & Translations

- Available in most languages.
- Adaptations for different age groups:
  - Adolescents (ages 12-15)
  - Children (ages 4-11)

## Taking the Test

Participants are presented with 50 statements and must choose one of the following options:

## Scoring

- **Range**: 0-50
- **Threshold**: 26 and above (scores of 26 or higher might indicate autism)
- **Statistical Insights**:
  - 79.3% of autistic people score 32 or higher[^2]
  - Average score for non-autistic males: 17
  - Average score for non-autistic females: 15

Scoring can be done through:

- Automated-scoring systems
- Self-scoring for personal documentation
