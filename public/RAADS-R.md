## Who the test is designed for

- Adults (age 16+) with ASD level 1 or subclinical autism.
- Adults with IQ in the normal range (IQ >=80).[1]

## Versions & translations

The RAADS-R has been translated into Swedish, and was also available in most languages through Google Translate. But as of 13 January 2022, it seems the online RAADS-R tests have been taken down. As far as we know, we are currently the only ones who host the RAADS-R online, albeit in English only.

## Taking the test

The RAADS-R is a self-report instrument. However, the authors mention that a clinician might help a participant interpret items if they have difficulty understanding the question.

The test assesses developmental symptoms correlating with the three DSM-5 diagnostic categories (Language, Social relatedness, and Sensory-motor), as well as a fourth subscale, Circumscribed interests. It consists of 80 statements, giving you 4 choices for each statement:

- True now and when I was young
- True now only
- True only when I was younger than 16
- Never true

If you decide to take the test, please consider the Discussion section below.

## Scoring
### Thresholds

The scoring range of the RAADS-R is 0-240. A score of 65+ indicates you are likely autistic, as no neurotypical scored above 64 in the research. A score of <65 means you are likely not autistic (97% chance of not being autistic). However, note that no single test is conclusive. For more certainty, we suggest taking a few other autism tests as well.

In the table below, you can see the threshold scores and maximum possible scores for the subscales of the RAADS-R.

#### RAADS-R scores

| Construct | Threshold score | Maximum score |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Total score | 65 | 240 |
| Language | 4 | 21 |
| Social relatedness | 31 | 117 |
| Sensory-motor | 16 | 60 |
| Circumscribed interests | 15 | 42 |

To see how your score compares to other people’s, have a look at the Average scores section. For more information on the RAADS-R subscales, have a look at the Subscales section below.

### Scoring methods

You can take the test using two methods:

- Automated-scoring
- Paper-based if you want documentation of your answers (you can find the scoring key at the bottom of the PDF)

### Scoring

The scoring of most of the statements (63) is as follows:

- True now and when I was young (3 points)
- True now only (2 points)
- True only when I was younger than 16 (1 point)
- Never true (0 points)

However, the point value is reversed for the 17 so-called normative questions:[2]

- True now and when I was young (0 points)
- True now only (1 point)
- True only when I was younger than 16 (2 points)
- Never true (3 points)

Below you can see an example of the first 3 questions, the first of which (denoted by an asterisk) is normative and thus has reversed scoring.

Example questions of the RAADS-R ('I am a sympathetic person', 'I often use words and phrases from movies and television in conversations', 'I am often surprised when others tell me I have been rude').

## Subscales

### Language

The language subscale is made up of 7 statements. The focus of these statements is on:

- Movie talk: Friends notice you’ve heard something new because you start using the word or phrase regularly.
- Small talk: A light conversation about unimportant things that people make during social interactions—instead of topics that are actually interesting and fun to talk about.
- Being literal: Having challenges when ‘what is said’ language does not match ‘what is meant’ language.

### Social relatedness

The social relatedness subscale is made up of 39 statements. The focus of these statements is on:

- Mentalization: Challenges with understanding what others are thinking or feeling.
- Mutual interests: Preferring to be with people with whom you share interests.
- Outsider: Being considered ‘different’.
- Bluntness: Being called rude; or that you have asked embarrassing questions; or pointed out when others have made an error.
- Dialectical reciprocity: Challenges knowing when it is your turn to talk, in a conversation or on the phone.
- Emotional reciprocity: Difficulty knowing when a person is flirting with you.
- Auditory processing issues: Challenges talking with several people at the same time.
- Object permanence: Not missing people when they’re absent.
- Maintaining relationships: Challenges making or keeping friends.
- Nonverbal communication: Challenges understanding body language.
- Mimicry/imitation: Copying others’ behaviour to fit in.
- Camouflaging: Hiding your automatic behaviours to fit in with others.

### Sensory-motor

The sensory-motor subscale is made up of 20 statements. The focus of these statements is on:

- Voice volume challenges: Talking very loud, not loud enough, or significant fluctuations between the two.
- Voice differences: Speaking monotone, like a child, or in silly voices.
- Motor control issues: Clumsiness and being uncoordinated.
- Sensory: Sensory stimulation that doesn’t bother others can be painful and overwhelming. The experience can differ significantly at various times or be context-dependent. You may get anxious when overstimulated.


### Circumscribed interests

The circumscribed interests subscale is made up of 14 statements. The focus of these statements is on:

- Details preference: focuses on details before the big picture, but can do both.
- Upset when the unexpected occurs: A dislike of someone changing your routine—this does not mean that you stick to your own routine, just that you dislike someone else changing YOUR routine.
- Special interests: Speaking about them, having them…

## Average scores

The table below shows the average total scores and subscores for people taking the RAADS-R online, divided by autistic people, suspected autistic people, and non-autistic people (neurotypicals).

#### Average RAADS-R scores

|    | Autistic  males | Autistic females | Suspected autistic males | Suspected autistic females | Neurotypical males | Neurotypical females |
|----|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Total score | 148.6 | 160.4 | 141.6 | 145.2 | 84.2 | 91.6 |
| Language | 11.9 | 12.8 | 11.2 | 11.3 | 6.6 | 6.8 |
| Social relatedness | 71.3 | 73.5 | 70.0 | 67.2 | 43.0 | 42.8 |
| Sensory/motor | 36.7 | 43.1 | 33.3 | 38.7 | 19.0 | 24.8 |
| Circumscr. interests | 28.7 | 31.0 | 27.2 | 28.0 | 15.7 | 17.2 |

_Autism threshold values: 65.0 (Total score), 4.0 (Language), 31.0 (Social relatedness), 16.0 (Sensory/motor), 15.0 (Circumscr. interests)_

### Mean scores

Because the table with average scores is based on skewed data, let me also present the mean scores from Ritvo's seminal paper:[3]

#### Mean RAADS-R scores

| | Mean total | Range | Language | Social relatedness | Sensory/motor | Circumscr. interests |
|---|------------|-------|----------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Autistic spectrum (n = 66) | 133.83 | 44-227 | 11.08 | 67.89 | 32.82 | 28.11 |
| Asperger (n = 135) | — | — | 10.06 | 65.07 | 28.96 | 27.44 |
| Controls (n = 276) | 25.95 | 0-65 | 1.86 | 9.24 | 5.26 | 5.03 |

## Validity

The RAADS-R is a reliable instrument to assist the diagnosis of autistic adults.[4]

- No neurotypical who took the test scored above the autism threshold.
- Only 3% of the autistic group did not score over 65.
- Test-retest reliability was high, particularly for the autistic group.[5]

Here is how the RAADS-R measures up:

#### RAADS-R validity

| Measure | Result | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Sensitivity | 97% | Test’s ability to identify positive results |
| Specificity | 100% | Test’s ability to identify negative results |
| Concurrent validity | 96% | Test’s validity compared with ADOS Module 4, SRS |
| Test-retest reliability | .987 | Test’s agreement between results of successive measurements |

* A total RAADS-R score of 65 or higher is consistent with the diagnosis of autism and supports a clinician's diagnosis. However, if there is a difference between the clinician’s diagnosis and the RAADS-R diagnostic assignment, the clinician’s diagnosis should take precedent. This is because symptoms may be revealed only during an interview.

* Also, the RAADS-R standardization study reported that many autism subjects, particularly those in their late teens and early twenties, failed to acknowledge the presence of symptoms that their families said were present and which were readily observed by the diagnostician.[6]

## The RAADS-R

- **[Automated-scoring](https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/#test)**
- **[Paper-based](https://embrace-autism.com/wp-content/uploads/RAADS–R.pdf)** if you want documentation of your answers (you can find the scoring key at the bottom of the PDF)

## What do my scores mean?

All scores of **65** or higher are indicative of autistic traits. The higher the score, the more autistic traits you have. In the table below are general interpretations of various total scores on the RAADS–R.

#### Meaning of RAADS–R scores

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| **25** | You are not autistic. |
| **50** | Some autistic traits, but likely not autistic (yet some autistic people score as low as **44**). |
| **65** | The minimum score at which autism is considered. |
| **90** | Stronger indications of autism, although non-autistics may score as high. |
| **130** | The mean score of autistic people; strong evidence for autism. |
| **160** | Very strong evidence for autism. |
| **227** | The maximum score autistic people acquired in Ritvo’s seminal paper on the RAADS–R.[^9] |
| **240** | The maximum possible RAADS–R score. |

Do note that no single test is conclusive, and not every autistic person necessarily scores above the defined threshold on each test. If you score low on the RAADS–R but still think you could be autistic, try taking a few other autism tests.
